# ðŸŒ± Cultivate (alpha)

Imagine if Notion & Basecamp had a baby. 

Cultivate is a PKM tool where you can calmly brain dump, write, manage projects, and get things done.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a alpha project in active development. There will be bugs and breaking changes. Please report any issues in the Issues tab.

## Stack

- [Wasp](https://wasp.sh) - a Rails-like framework for JS, with a focus on reducing boilerplate
- [Shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - a beautiful component library/framework
- [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/) - Beautiful & consistent icons

## How to Run

1. [Download the Wasp Compiler](https://wasp.sh/docs/quick-start)
2. Install Docker or [Orbstack](https://orbstack.dev/) (recommended for macOS). Wasp uses this to standup the database.
3. Run `wasp db migrate-dev` to set up the database schema. This command also automatically runs the seed script (`src/server/scripts/seedDevData.ts`) which creates a default user (`dev_user` / `password`) if no users exist, and ensures the initial invite code (`JESUS-SAVES`) is available.
4. Run `wasp start` to get the app running locally at `localhost:3000`

## Contributing

This project is open source code and open to ideas, with the direction honed in by its creator, Cam Pak.

If you create a PR, there's a chance I will not merge it in if it doesn't align with the heart and vision of Cultivate.
